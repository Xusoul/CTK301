        <h2>My Works</h2>
          <h3>Here's some things I've created.</h3>
            <p>Below, you'll find some of my works. Everything here has been created by me on both good and bad days. Feel free to click on any of the icons for a better view of each of the picture and a brief explaination of it.</p>
          <h3>Game Design Project Pictures:</h3>
            <p>Here, we have pictures of players playing the second game I made for my CTK 351 game design course. It was a card game with a focus on player interaction and storytelling. Made by me and a friend of mine, Cam.</p>

            <a href="GameDesignPhotos/playerDiscussingWithCard.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="Here we have a group of players showcasing how the game would be played. The cards are used to outline the gameplay, but the game mostly centers on players creating their own stories.">

          <h3>Other Sketches..</h3>
            <p>These are just my own works I do on the side, they don't really have anything to do with the game design ones above. Just something I do for fun on my own time.</p>
